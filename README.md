# game-tournament

As of right now, you can play a game between two players, using their AC4.re, BC4.re, APlayer.re, and BPlayer.re files. The game will show the board and their logins and each piece as it gets played, and will also check that (a) the players do not input valid moves, (b) the moves take <= 3.5 seconds, and (c) whether any player has won or lost the game yet. We still have to add in error checking for when (d) a contestant thinks the game is over, and (e) if any other failwiths are hit in the contestants' files.
